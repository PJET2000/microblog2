In my quest to simplify life and write this blog, I want to think through these concepts myself while also considering the insights others have shared on the topic. Among the books I’ve come across, "Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less" by Greg McKeown is the one that most closely aligns with what I aim to establish here. The book has both strengths and weaknesses. While it offers valuable insights, it's written in a somewhat tedious, startup-esque language and, at times, contradicts its own principles. Particularly in the latter part, McKeown veers away from his central theme of focusing on the essentials, instead delving into various pieces of general life advice.

Therefore, this post will not be a general summary of the book—you can find many of those online—but rather a collection of the most essential points that have helped me personally to gain clarity.

# Less but Better

The core idea of essentialism is the relentless pursuit of less but better in every aspect of life.

## Highest Point of Contribution

As an essentialist, you should always seek out your highest point of contribution and focus solely on that. This means:

- Don’t just take good opportunities; always ask if this is the *best* and *most important* use of your resources.
- Reflect on this question: "Is this how I want to spend my one wild and precious life?"

## The Trivial Many

To an essentialist, almost everything falls into the category of the trivial many. The key is to identify the vital few. Once you have recognized the trivial many, it's crucial to set clear boundaries to create the space needed for focusing on the vital few.

- **Risk upsetting some people with clear boundaries:** Setting boundaries (and wisely dedicating your time to the vital few) may upset some initially, but it will earn you greater respect in the long run.
- **Saying no:**
  - A clear "no" is more graceful than a vague or noncommittal "yes."
  - Focus all your time on the work that you are uniquely fitted to do well.
  - Having a reputation as an essentialist makes this process easier.
  - **Strategies:**
    - Pause for three seconds before answering.
    - Ask, "Yes, what should I deprioritize?"
    - Say, "Let me check my calendar and get back to you."
    - Offer alternatives: "You are welcome to X. I am willing to Y." For example, "I can send you a video on how to repair your flat tire, but I can't do it myself right now."

## Trade-offs

As an essentialist, you have to accept the reality of trade-offs and make deliberate choices about them. In this sense, essentialism is a heightened awareness of your ability to choose.

- A choice is an action, not something that just happens.
- **Questions to make choices easier:**
  - Shift from "What do I give up?" to "What do I want to go big on?"
  - Ask, "Which problem do I want?"
- **Against the mentality of "I can do both":**
  - Choose instead of adopting a *straddled* strategy.

Thus, we shouldn’t ignore trade-offs but embrace them, making deliberate, strategic, and thoughtful choices.

A good implementation strategy might be similar to minimalism regarding your material possessions: whenever you introduce something new, always ask, "What am I willing to let go of for this?"


# Reflection 
What I felt was missing in McKeown's book, and what distinguishes his essentialism from the approach I'm exploring here on the blog, is a deeper focus on mindfulness, mental organization, and single-tasking. While his idea of concentrating on what's truly important resonates with me, my approach is more about a gradual process of decluttering, much like minimalism in the home.

For me, this journey is less about finding a one-size-fits-all solution and more about discovering what it means to live with less—less mental clutter, fewer distractions, fewer tasks that don't add value. I’m not just seeking to accomplish more with less; I'm searching for a way to live more intentionally, with a quieter mind and a clearer sense of purpose. Through this blog, I’m documenting my own path towards a simpler, more mindful life, learning as I go, and sharing the insights I gather along the way.
